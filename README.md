## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using multiple background images:

```css
body {
  font-size: 15px;
  font-family: 'Spartan', sans-serif;
  background-image: url("/images/bg-pattern-top-desktop.svg"), url("/images/bg-pattern-bottom-desktop.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
  background-position: top 0 left 0px, bottom 200px right 50px;
  background-size: 100%, 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

Many few projects ahead I will try Tailwindcss and Vite.js.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Basics: Using Multiple Backgrounds](https://css-tricks.com/css-basics-using-multiple-backgrounds/) - With CSS, you can control the background of elements. You can set a background-color to fill it with a solid color, a background-image to fill it with (you guessed it) an image, or even both.
